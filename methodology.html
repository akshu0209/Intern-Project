                <h5>Ph.D. Research Methodology: Mentoring & Rewriting Guidance</h5>
                <p>Doing Ph.D. Research is scientific, methodological way of finding answers to hypothetical questions. Since research methodology gives direction for conducting your thesis and affects your results and how you conclude the findings, , it requires special and complete attention. Moreover, research is considered as an academic activity, thus always terms should be used in a technical sense. As soon as candidates register for their Ph.D., there are several major questions that they ask themselves such as "How to Research?" and 'What to research? ‘and central question would be 'why research?'
                    Research can be a method of finding solution to a problem or it can also involve in formulation of a theory. Hence to formulate a theory or to find answer to question, researchers need to familiarize with appropriate methods. In general, research objectives fall into several following broad groupings.</p>

            <h2>Ph.D. research methodology writing –systematic approach</h2>
            <p>We follow the systematic approach for writing the methodology chapter by writing in a more logical and accessible style.

                Planning what to research:
                1.1 Framing a research questions (Reviewing the literature, formulating the research problems, identify the variables and constructing hypotheses)
                Developing a research study:
                2.1 research design conceptualization (Develop the research design, choosing the right study design, philosophy, strategy, time horizon)
                2.2. Building an instrument for data collection (choosing a method of data collection, collecting data using attitudinal scales (qualitative and quantitative research), developing reliability and validity of a research instrument
                3. selecting a sample
                4. collecting the data (ethical issues)
                5. process data and displaying data (data processing in qualitative and quantitative studies, display the data (text, tables, figures and graph). The other sections of this chapter are as follows: research design, philosophy approach, research strategy, population, sampling, sample size, data collection methods (primary or secondary), reliability, validity, pilot study, ethics, statistical analysis which will be used to analyze the data.</p>

            <h3>How will Ph.D. Assistance structure your Ph.D. Dissertation Literature Review?</h3>
            <p><b>At Ph.D. Assistance, we mentor on the following different types of research.</b></p>
            <p>Descriptive Versus Analytical:This research includes fact finding enquiries or surveys of different kinds. In business research, it is called as Ex post facto research. Researcher does not have control over the variables. In analytical research, researcher uses the information already available and analyses the information critically and presents it.

                Applied vs. Fundamental: Action (Applied) research aims at finding a solution for an immediate problem facing an industry or business or society, while basic (fundamental) is concerned with generalizations with formulation of a theory.
                
                Qualitative or Quantitative research: Quantitative research focuses on numbers and measurement while qualitative research aims more at thoroughly describing a situation or explaining reasons for a problem or circumstances
                
                Conceptual Vs Empirical: Abstract idea (s) or theory is conceptual research and used by philosophers while empirical (experimental) research relies on observation or experience alone. In this type of research, researcher must provide a working hypothesis and prove or disprove the same using appropriate methodology.
                
                Other types of Research: Based on the purpose of research Ph.D. Candidates can also choose other type of research such as longitudinal research, field setting research, simulation research, laboratory research, clinical or diagnostic research, historical research, conclusion oriented research, operation research, decision oriented research.
                
                However, type of research is based on the purpose of your Ph.D. study. It is always good to contact research methodology expertise of your area for more valuable information.</p>
