                <h5>Mentoring a Ph.D. Dissertation Literature Review</h5>
                <p>A dissertation literature review contributes 40 percent of weight. Hence, more effort should be taken to collect exhaustive, up-to-date literature, which has been published from various countries or conducted among different ethnic groups. The challenging things in literature review are: Comparison of different authors’ view, critically viewing the methodology, finding gaps in research, going through the research study having linkage to previous studies, understanding the parameters of research, etc. All these challenging needs do require reviewing the literature extensively. In this respect, the requisite is to collect relevant literature including the aspect of empirical, historical, philosophical literature related to a problem stated. A review of available literature is an important part of any academic research study.</p>

        <div class="dissertation-s4">
            <h2>Engaging expertise who have studied the topic would enhance your research - A Trusted Ph.D. Literature Review Mentoring Support</h2>
            <p>Our team of Ph.D. experts will carry out an extensive review of contextual published research on relevant theoretical concepts or models on which you intend to base your dissertation. It requires comparing the views and conclusions of a wide range of authors to have own views. The views enunciated out of it must be 'critical' in nature and not just a regurgitation of the literature. We will try to highlight the limitations or contentious aspects of studies you have gone through (for example, their theoretical underpinnings, research design or interpretation of findings) or identify gaps in the literature. Identifying the gap in the study is the rationale behind reviewing literature.

                However, there is a systematic way to review the literature to identify and discuss the key themes and contributions. This results in getting aware of relevant issues on the part of researchers. Others have received far less attention, perhaps because their origins are relatively recent or because they have simply been neglected. Hence, the need is to have the quality of research studies at the disposal having relevance to your research topic. Once the Ph.D. dissertation literature is reviewed, we will reflect the gaps in the literature for addressing and/or which models/frameworks or ideas will take forward to help structure Ph.D. literature review.</p>
